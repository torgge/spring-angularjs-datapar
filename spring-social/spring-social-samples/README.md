Spring Social Samples
=====================
This repository contains sample projects illustrating usage of the Spring Social project.

Samples include:
 * **spring-social-quickstart**, designed to get you up and running quickly in a Spring Framework 3.1 or > environment.
 * **spring-social-showcase**, illustrating most of the features.
 * **spring-social-showcase-sec**, a version of spring-social-showcase that uses SocialAuthenticationFilter instead of  ProviderSignInController for a tighter integration with Spring Security. 
 * **spring-social-canvas**, a variation of spring-social-quickstart that is intended to run as a Facebook Canvas application.

Some older and less maintained examples have been moved into the "attic".

See the README in each sub directory for information on the sample and instructions on how to run the samples.
