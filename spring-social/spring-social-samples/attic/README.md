Spring Social Samples Attic
===========================

In the interest of refining the set of examples for Spring Social and to reduce the amount of maintenance on examples alone, some of the older Spring Social sample applications have been placed here, in the attic. These examples will not be maintained as much as those outside of the attic, but please feel free to review them for their historic value. Also, community-led maintenance is certainly welcome via pull requests.

Samples in the attic include:
 * **spring-social-popup**, demonstrates how to do a popup-based connection flow.
 * **spring-social-quickstart-3.0.x**, a version of the quickstart that is Spring Framework 3.0.x compatible. (Note that as of Spring Social 1.1, Spring Social no longer supports Spring 3.0.) 
 * **spring-social-showcase-xml**, a version of spring-social-showcase that uses XML-based configuration.
 * **spring-social-showcase-sec-xml**, a version of spring-social-showcase that uses both XML-based configuration and SocialAuthenticationFilter.
 * **spring-social-movies**, showing how to extend the framework to implement a new ServiceProvider + API binding.
 * **spring-social-twitter4j**, showing how to extend the framework and re-use an existing API binding (also shows XML config, multiple connections per provider, and is Spring 3.0.x compatible).
