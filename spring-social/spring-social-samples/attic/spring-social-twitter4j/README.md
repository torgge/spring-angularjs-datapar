Spring Social Showcase Twitter4j
================================
This sample app is a trimmed down version of Spring Social Showcase and demonstrates how to create a new
service provider implementation that leverages an existing Java API binding. In this case, a new
Twitter service provider is created that uses Twitter4J as the API binding.

This sample also shows Spring XML config as an alternative to Java config.

Finally, this sample shows how a user can connect to multiple provider accounts e.g. several Twitter accounts.

To run, simply import the project into your IDE and deploy to a Servlet 2.5 or > container such as Tomcat 6 or 7.
Access the project at http://localhost:8080/spring-social-twitter4j
